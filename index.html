                        Honestly, it feels very weird to have my own website. As the stereotypical youngest child, I love attention, but I can't help but despise advertising myself for the whole world to see. Perhaps that's a midwest thing? Or maybe the fact that I'm secretly 80-years-old. Who's to say? <br>
			    <br>
			    I was born and raised in Omaha, NE, and graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2021. I'm the youngest of four and all of us were born in a five year period. I did what I could to stand out among my siblings but somehow ended up enjoying the same activities they did, such as newspaper. I actually come from a family of journalists, but I never thought I'd actually be a journalist until I wrote my first story. I was instantly hooked. <br>
			    <br>
			    Still, my mom insisted I put my "math brain" to good use. So, I entered the world of data journalism with the help of my colleagues at Climate Change Nebraska, The New York Times, The Salt Lake Tribune and The Dow Jones News Fund. In 2021, I was part of The New York Times' Pulitzer Prize winning team that collected data related to COVID-19 cases across the U.S. — including the incarcerated population. <br> 
			    <br>
			    Between July 2021 and January 2024, I served as the data reporter at the San Antonio Express-News via the Texas Development Hub, and I then worked at the Flatwater Free Press as their first election guide editor. I'm currently a UChicago graduate student studying Computational Analysis and Public Policy. I will graduate in June 2026. Explore my data-related journalism endeavors below.  <br>

                        <p>
                            San Antonio has a stray dog problem. The San Antonio 311 database is filled with animal complaints — including reports of dog bites — across the city. When I learned that someone had died after a dog attacked them, I wanted to write a story that showed how often bites occur. Working with an editor, we realized that the ZIP code where a man had recently died was also the place where the most bites had been reported. This information shifted the story a bit, and I wrote about my findings.

                            In Bexar County — home to San Antonio — first time DWI offenders who meet specific criteria are allowed to receive a lesser charge known as "obstruction." Reporters approached me and wanted to know the effectiveness of this program, and through my analysis, we learned that this program — called "Taking Responsibility" — actually allows people to avoid it. <br>
				<br>
			Our work prompted the county to take a look at this program, and official changes are pending. Our code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/Houston-Chronicle/sa-obstruct">here. </a> <br>

                        <p>
                            During the beginning of my time at Hearst, I was given a task to make a database of children who died after being restrained. One name unfortunately led to several other names — until we compiled a database of more than 80 children and young adults.  <br>
				<br>
				That database was a part of a larger investigation about seclusion and restraint in schools across the country. My colleagues and I worked tirelessly to tell the stories of children across the country who have been restrained. In addition to leading the database creation, I co-wrote a story about restraints in Texas. That story focussed on two families: one family whose child had died after a restraint and another family whose children had been restrained several times. <br>
				<br>
			Our efforts <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Unacceptable-lawmakers-pursue-reforms-around-17553529.php">caught the attention of officials nationwide. </a> and sparked a conversation about restraint in schools.

                           On the night of the Uvalde massacre, I twiddled my thumbs; I knew I needed to do something, but I didn't know what data could help this situation. How could a data journalist help cover this tragedy? <br>
				<br>
				Well, then I remembered question I've wanted to know after every mass shooting: When would the conversation dry up? When would the calls for action end? <br>
				<br>
				So, I set up a Twitter scraper so I could gather the most recent tweets containing the word "Uvalde." And after several months of analysis/data collection, I wrote about my findings.

                           A reporter approached me with an incredible story idea that she had thoroughly researched. She knew that San Antonio residents who lived on the Southside had worse access to healthcare. It was just a matter of using data to prove it. <br>

                        <p>
                           In April 2020, The New York Times reporter Timothy Williams and I began putting together a spreadsheet to track COVID-19 cases across the U.S. I had never talked to an inmate before and knew very little about criminal justice, but Timothy believed in my abilities as a journalist and had me report. I felt so lucky to be reporting for NYT, and I was honored that people were sharing their harrowing stories with me, trusting me to tell it. A group of other New York Times reporters and I spent the past year talking to inmates, loved ones, prison officials, and non-profits so we could track COVID-19 cases. Our results are harrowing, as shown in the article and in <a href="https://twitter.com/LibbySeline/status/1380883617174450176?s=20"> this Twitter thread. </a>
